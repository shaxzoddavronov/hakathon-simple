"""Engines package.

This module is intentionally side-effect-free so importing
``app.engines.base`` from anywhere — including the read-only validator —
does not eagerly load concrete adapters.

Concrete adapters register themselves with :data:`DIALECT_REGISTRY` only
when their module is imported. Callers that need *any* dialect resolved
(API routes, Celery tasks, app startup) must explicitly call
:func:`register_all` once before invoking ``get_engine``.
